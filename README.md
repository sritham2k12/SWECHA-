Automated Code Analysis and Evaluation System

The Automated Code Analysis and Evaluation System is designed to offer an in-depth and automated evaluation of programming code quality. By utilizing advanced techniques and the Llama 3.1 LLM, the system analyzes code across several key factors including:

Readability: Assessing how easy it is for developers to understand the code, focusing on clarity and structure.
Complexity: Measuring the complexity of the code, identifying areas that could be simplified to improve maintainability and readability.
Naming Conventions: Checking whether variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers follow standard naming conventions for consistency and clarity.
Error Handling: Evaluating how errors are managed within the code, ensuring robustness and stability.
Duplication: Identifying repetitive code segments that can be refactored to reduce redundancy and improve maintainability.
Formatting: Ensuring code follows consistent formatting practices for indentation, spacing, and line breaks.
Security Concerns: Detecting potential security risks such as hard-coded private keys, passwords, or other sensitive data within the code.
The system generates a comprehensive report that includes detailed insights, data visualizations (such as graphs), and actionable suggestions to improve code quality in all of these areas. This ensures that code meets industry standards, is maintainable, and is secure.

Moreover, it is designed to address only programming-related queries, making the analysis focused and relevant to code quality evaluation.
